<h1>Panic Picker</h1>
Tool for helping users pick what they would like fo dinner

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Users can click a button to receive a suggestion from the application on what style of food to have for dinner.
Based on what food type is randomly selected by the applicaiton, an associated icon will appear and also a search will be performed on the inbuilt Google map. This map uses geo-location to determine the users location (permission required) and using this data with the Google Maps API, the map will populate with the nearest locations that type of food is available.
